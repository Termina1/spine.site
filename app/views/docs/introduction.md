Spine is a lightweight framework for building JavaScript web applications. Spine gives you a MVC structure and then gets out of your way, allowing you to concentrate on the fun stuff, building awesome web applications.

Spine is opinionated and, 

Spine is tiny, the library comes in at around 500 lines of JavaScript, that's about 2K minified & compressed. However, it's not about size, it's how you use it, and Spine certainly packs a punch!

##JavaScript Web Applications


##Core values

* *MVC* - The MVC pattern, or Model View Controller, is at the heart of Spine applications. It ensures your application is modular, name-spaced and doesn't descend into a mess of view and model logic by having a consistent architecture. It's great for teams, and brings a well needed structure to JavaScript development. 

* *Asynchronous interfaces* - Too many JavaScript applications & frameworks don't take full advantage of the power of client-side rendering. End-users don't care if background requests to the server are pending, and don't want to see loading messages and spinners. Users want unblocked interfaces, and instant interaction. To enable this, Spine stores and renders everything client side, communicating with the server asynchronously. 

* *Simplicity* - Spine is a minimum possible viable product. It doesn't dictate your views, your HTML or your CSS. It not a huge framework consisting of twenty different kinds of widgets. The goal is to get out your way; letting you go ahead and do what you do best, build awesome web applications.

##Why should you use Spine?

JavaScript frameworks are a dime a dozen, and more are appearing everyday. So what makes Spine so special? 

* Built in a real-world environment
* Lightweight controller implementation (based on Backbone's API)
* Full model layer and ORM
* Ajax and HTML5 Local Storage adapters baked in
* Asynchronous server communication
* Works in all major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE >= 7)
* Simple and lightweight
* Great documentation

But don't take my word for it. Take a look at the source of the [example applications](<%= pages_path("examples") %>), and decide for yourself.

##CoffeeScript 

Spine is written in [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/), a little language that compiles into JavaScript. You don't have to write Spine applications in CoffeeScript, pure JavaScript will work fine. However, using CoffeeScript will be the path of least resistance, and the one I personally advocate. 

CoffeeScript won't be everyone's cup of tea, and I've no doubt it'll turn some people of the framework. However, if you've qualms about the language, I urge you to at least give it a chance and check it out; you should understand what you're missing. I personally think CoffeeScript is a complete revolution in programming for the web.

For an introduction to the language, see the [The Little Book on CoffeeScript](http://arcturo.github.com/library/coffeescript/)
